# 🧠 Computer Vision Research Projects  
A collection of deep learning experiments focused on image classification, CNN architectures, and transformer-based models — all implemented from scratch as part of my self-driven research journey into Computer Vision.

Each project in this repository explores a different architecture, training strategy, or dataset, with the goal of understanding model behavior beyond just accuracy numbers.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Project | Dataset | Architecture | Highlight |
|---------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification` | Kaggle Cats vs Dogs | Custom CNN | Baseline binary classifier built & trained from scratch |
| `LeNet5_on_MNIST` | MNIST Digits | LeNet-5 | Recreated the classic 1998 paper architecture with backprop from scratch |
| `VGG16_on_CIFAR10` | CIFAR-10 | VGG-16 | Full CNN with 5 blocks, dropout regularization, trained from scratch (no transfer learning) |
| `ViT_on_CIFAR10` | CIFAR-10 | Vision Transformer (ViT) | 4 progressive models exploring patch embedding, augmentation, regularization, and depth scaling |

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists  
Instead of only using pre-trained models, this repo focuses on **understanding architectures by building them manually** — layer by layer, block by block.

> *The goal is not just to get high accuracy, but to understand **why models behave the way they do** under different conditions (data size, depth, dropout, augmentation, etc.)*

## 📖 Documentation & Blogs  
All these research experiments and important deep learning concepts are documented in a dedicated blog series, where I explain architecture intuition, implementation details, experiment results, and research takeaways.
